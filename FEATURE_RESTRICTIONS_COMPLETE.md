## üí° Customization Guide

### Adding a New Feature Restriction:

1. **Add to planFeatures.js:**
```javascript
export const PLAN_FEATURES = {
  free: {
    yourNewFeature: false,  // ‚ùå Not available
  },
  premium: {
    yourNewFeature: true,   // ‚úÖ Available
  },
  ultimate: {
    yourNewFeature: true,   // ‚úÖ Available
  }
};
```

2. **Update App.js Tab (if it's a main tab):**
```javascript
{hasFeature(currentPlan, 'yourNewFeature') && (
  <button className="tab" onClick={() => setActiveTab('newfeature')}>
    üéØ New Feature
  </button>
)}
```

3. **Add Feature with Upgrade Prompt:**
```javascript
{activeTab === 'newfeature' && (
  hasFeature(currentPlan, 'yourNewFeature') ? (
    <YourNewFeatureComponent />
  ) : (
    <UpgradePrompt 
      feature="yourNewFeature"
      requiredPlan="premium"  // or "ultimate"
      onUpgrade={() => setShowSubscriptionModal(true)}
      fullScreen={true}
    />
  )
)}
```

4. **Update UpgradePrompt feature names:**
```javascript
// In src/components/UpgradePrompt/index.js
const featureNames = {
  // ... existing features ...
  yourNewFeature: 'Your New Feature Name',
};
```

### Changing Server Restrictions:

Edit `src/config/planFeatures.js`:
```javascript
free: {
  servers: {
    allowedServers: ['1', '2', '3', '4'],  // Add server ID '4'
    maxLocations: 4,                        // Update count
  }
}
```

### Adjusting Bandwidth Limits:

```javascript
free: {
  bandwidth: {
    limited: true,
    monthlyLimit: 20,  // Change from 10GB to 20GB
  }
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Client-Side Only (Current):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All restrictions are enforced in React
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Technically bypassable with browser dev tools
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need backend validation for production

### Backend Integration (Recommended):
```javascript
// Verify plan on server before allowing actions
app.post('/api/connect', authenticate, async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findById(req.userId);
  const feature = 'multiHop';
  
  if (!hasFeature(user.plan, feature)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ 
      error: 'Premium plan required',
      requiredPlan: 'premium' 
    });
  }
  
  // Proceed with connection...
});
```

### Best Practices:
1. Validate plan on every API request
2. Store plan in JWT token
3. Sync plan changes across all user sessions
4. Log feature access attempts for analytics
5. Rate limit upgrade attempts to prevent abuse

---

## üì± Responsive Design

All upgrade prompts and restrictions work on:
- ‚úÖ Desktop (1920x1080+)
- ‚úÖ Laptop (1366x768)
- ‚úÖ Tablet (768x1024)
- ‚úÖ Mobile (375x667)

Prompts automatically adjust:
- Full-screen on mobile
- Modal-style on desktop
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Readable typography at all sizes

3. **FAQ Section**: "Which plan is right for me?"
4. **Use Cases**: "Best for streaming", "Best for businesses"
5. **Demo Videos**: Show premium features in action
